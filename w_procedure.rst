Step 5.
	Justin checks whether article has DOI registered for the article in question (i.e. whether article has been published in "Advance Online Publications"). 

	How to check whether article has DOI registered:

	a). Type in (possible) article DOI in browser address field and press "enter". You can compile DOI by adding article PII to the following link: https://doi.org/10.18632/oncotarget.<PII here>. |br|
	For example, DOI for PII 25832 is https://doi.org/10.18632/oncotarget.25832

	b). If you get "DOI Not Found" page, then DOI has **not** been regisered for the article. Any other result would mean that artcile has DOI.

Step 6B.

	Steps in OJS.


	On "Editing" tab of the article in "SCHEDULING" section, select "Deleted" from the list of the issues and click on "Record" button.
